Basic methodology-The system will take the headline or entire article, crawl through the first few pages of web results and then generate a truth report related to the news and then cross verify the results and then give the final report.
Methods used for project implementation-1)Web crawling
2)Database management
3)website development
4)information processing with the help of AI.
Technologies used-1)Database-mongodb or SAP(Pronounced and  “S” + “A” + “P” ) Hana
2)Web development-Scripting-Python and frontend-*
3)Web crawler-Python based API
4)Information processing -Keras library over tensorflow with NLP API's in python.
Estimated time: It would take 2 to 3 months for the completion of the project.
Steps in Implementation:
	Stage 1:Building of the web crawler(Time -1 week)
	Stage 2:Setting up of DBMS (1-2 weeks)
	Stage 3 :Information processing(1-2 months)
	Stage 4:Creating the website(20 -25 days)
Starting with the web crawler the team will be working on these technologies simultaneously tackling a problem at a time.
